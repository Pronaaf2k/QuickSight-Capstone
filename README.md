# QuickSight: Junior Capstone Project for CSE299

**QuickSight** is a Flutter-based application developed as my **Junior Capstone Project** for **CSE299** at **North South University**. The application addresses accessibility challenges by offering innovative features for individuals with visual impairments or color-related difficulties.

## Features

### 1. **Colorblindness Simulations**
QuickSight offers color correction modes to assist users with various types of colorblindness:
- **Deuteranopia Mode**: Red-green colorblindness optimization.
- **Tritanopia Mode**: Blue-yellow colorblindness optimization.
- **Protanopia Mode**: Enhanced for those with difficulty distinguishing red and green hues.

### 2. **Quick Sight Tool**
A core feature that combines cutting-edge AI and text-to-speech technology:
- **Image-to-Text Conversion**: Uses OpenAI's API to extract textual information from an image.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the extracted text into spoken words for auditory accessibility.

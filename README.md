# QuickSight: Junior Capstone Project for CSE299

**QuickSight** is a Flutter-based frontend and Python-based Backend application developed as my **Junior Capstone Project** for **CSE299** at **North South University**. The application addresses accessibility challenges by offering innovative features for individuals with visual impairments or color-related difficulties.

---

## Project Overview

The primary goal of QuickSight is to provide an accessible and inclusive tool that empowers users to overcome challenges related to colorblindness and visual impairments. QuickSight combines **colorblindness simulation** with advanced **AI-powered image-to-text conversion** and **text-to-speech capabilities** to deliver a practical and impactful solution.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Colorblindness Color Corrections**
QuickSight includes Color Corrections modes for three types of colorblindness:
- **Deuteranopia**: Red-green colorblindness simulation.
- **Tritanopia**: Blue-yellow colorblindness simulation.
- **Protanopia**: Red-green hue differentiation difficulty simulation.

These simulations are designed to help users with colorblindness and raise awareness among individuals without such impairments.

---

### 2. **Quick Sight Tool**
A powerful feature designed to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals:
- **Image-to-Text Conversion**: Extracts text from images using the OpenAI API.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts the extracted text into speech using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library, allowing users to hear the content.

---

## Technologies Used

### Development Tools
- **Flutter**: Framework for cross-platform development.
- **Dart**: Programming language used for Flutter.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for managing AI requests.

### APIs and Libraries
- **OpenAI API**: Used for image-to-text conversion.
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: Provides text-to-speech functionality.
- **Camera Plugin**: Captures images for text extraction.

### Python Libraries
The project leverages several Python libraries for backend functionality. Below are the required libraries and installation instructions.

## Python Dependencies

### Required Libraries
Here is a list of Python libraries you need to install for the backend:

1. **`numpy`**: For numerical computations.
2. **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. **`openai`**: To interact with the OpenAI API.
4. **`python-dotenv`**: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.
5. **`fastapi`**: For building the API backend.
6. **`uvicorn`**: To run the FastAPI app.
7. **`gtts`**: For converting text to speech.
8. **`opencv-python`**: For image processing (`cv2` module).
9. **`python-multipart`**: Required by FastAPI for handling file uploads.
10. **`requests`**: For making API requests.

### Installation Command
Install all dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas openai python-dotenv fastapi uvicorn gtts opencv-python python-multipart requests
```

### Standard Library
The following modules are part of Python‚Äôs standard library and do not require installation:
- `os`, `csv`, `base64`, `time`, `datetime`, `logging`, `shutil`.

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Features Walkthrough
1. **Colorblindness Color Corrections**:
   - Navigate to Colorblind Menu.
   - Choose between Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, or Protanopia modes.
     
2. **Quick Sight Tool**:
   - Tap the lower end of the screen,
   - Automatically the phones camera will turn on.
   - The app will process the text and read it aloud.
   - Tap the screen to go back to home.
